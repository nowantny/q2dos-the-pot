To port a mod to Q2DOS the following changes must occur:

* q_shared.c and q_shared.h need to be merged with the ones in /game.
  There as some string safe functions that are used throughout the engine
  as well as some DJGPP specific stuff.  It's needed!

* game.h needs dprintf changed to:
  void (*dprintf) (unsigned long developerFlags, char *fmt, ...);

* ALL gi.dprintfs need to be changed to this format:
  gi.dprintf (DEVELOPER_MSG_GAME, "%s", ...)

  This is so you can use the developer flags to filter game dll
  specific messages.

* The DXE has to be built using dxe3gen with -U, and must export
  only _GetGameAPI(), i.e.:  dxe3gen -U -E _GetGameAPI ....
  Run your mod (like "q2 +set game yourmod") and see if it errors
  out with a message like "unresolved symbols in dxe": if it does,
  see the generated DXE.LOG file for details, and report it to me.

Good luck!
