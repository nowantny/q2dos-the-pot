From Yamagi Q2:
# -O2 are enough optimizations.
#
# -fno-strict-aliasing since the source doesn't comply
#  with strict aliasing rules and it's next to impossible
#  to get it there...
#
# -fomit-frame-pointer since the framepointer is mostly
#  useless for debugging Quake II and slows things down.
#
# -g to build always with debug symbols. Please DO NOT
#  CHANGE THIS, since it's our only chance to debug this
#  crap when random crashes happen!

From a rogue post on reddit:
Quake2 also has other issues with floating point math. R1Q2 compiles with 
-ffloat-store because apparently the original client and server (and the 
windows version) stored intermediates in memory. If the server and client 
don't do the same thing you will get significant prediction error (resulting 
in rubberbanding) in some places.

We personally haven't seen any rubberbanding issues, it also takes a 3-4fps hit
via timedemo testing.  On a P1, those extra 3-4 frames really make the
difference.  If we see issues down the road, well... here's the note!
