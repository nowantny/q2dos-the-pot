+-----------------------------------------+

1 - What's required?
---------------------------------------------------------
* Pentium 1.  At least a 200MHz to play it at ~20-30fps.
* At least 48 MB RAM.  More for larger mods.
* LFN TSR.  Use the included DOSLFN.ZIP (can be loaded high with LH DOSLFN.COM)

2 - What works?
---------------------------------------------------------
* VGA (320x200 and 320x240)
* SVGA (Banked and LFB)
* 3DFX OpenGL rendering.
* Mouse
* Keyboard
* Sound Blaster and Gravis UltraSound family
* CD-ROM music
* OGG and WAV music
* Networking (You need a packet driver)
* Loading/unloading video driver and game DLLs in DXE3 format.

3 - What works but needs more testing?
---------------------------------------------------------
* Playing in a Windows 9x DOS box.
* Several PCI sound cards like AC'97 or HDA (run with -sndpci)
* Mouse wheel support. (see info below.)
* Hor+ FOV scaling. (see info below.)

4 - What doesn't work
---------------------------------------------------------
* Playing in a Windows NT NTVDM DOS box.  If you must, +set sw_mode 1.
* Software Renderer: TGA files from maps that were only optimized for OpenGL.
* Some models from Whale's WODX server can crash the software renderer.  I'm
  assuming they're custom player models as I tried replaying the same maps
  later and got no crashes.  Until I can spot it, be on the lookout.

5 - Tips and other misc. info
---------------------------------------------------------
* Run /slist2 to get a gamespy list of active servers, or use the new browser
  menu.  Run /srelist to print the previous list.  Use CTRL+C to abort.
* Don't use EMM386.  If you get weird virtual alloc failed errors,
  it's probably related to this.
* Use FastVid for some faster linear frame buffering if you a P1 or P2-era PC.
  Download it at http://dk.toastednet.org/QDOS/FASTV110.ZIP.
* UNIRV can enable custom refresh rates.  Great if you have a large CRT monitor.
  Download it at http://dk.toastednet.org/QDOS/UNIRV142.ZIP.
* Gravis UltraSound users:  If you have a "stuck" or "repeating" sound as soon
  you load Q2DOS load Ultramid -Q then Ultramid -Q -F.  If you don't have
  Ultramid for some reason, you can get the fix (with a batch included) at
  http://dk.toastednet.org/QDOS/GUSFIX.ZIP.
  You also may need to set s_mixahead to 0.3 and use high DMAs.
* Make sure you are using the included CWSDPMI.EXE in your Q2 directory or you
  may get some issues with running out of memory.
* To hear Ogg Vorbis or WAV tracks in game, rip the Q2 CD's audio tracks (2-11)
  to track02-track11.* and put them in baseq2/music.  For the mission pack 
  audio tracks, rip the Ground Zero CD's audio tracks (2-11) to 
  track12-track21.*.  Don't bother ripping the tracks from the Reckoning CD,
  as they're a mix of the tracks on the Q2 and Ground Zero CDs.  Everything
  else will be taken care of internally.
* Mouse wheel:  The code is from HoT.  If you use the latest beta version of
  cutemouse, which  is 2.1b3 (ctmouse21b3.zip), the wheel should work nicely.
  We tested with the 2.0-alpha and 2.1-beta versions. We automatically detect
  and use the wheel if it is present. To disable the wheel, use the command
  line argument -nowheel.
  - Note: As of cutemouse-2.1-beta4 version (cutemouse21b4.zip), the wheel is
    not enabled by default: you must use their /O switch.
* Hor+ style field of view (FOV) scaling: Useful for widescreen resolutions.
  Configured by new cvar fov_adapt: set it to 1 and your FOV will be scaled
  automatically according to the resolution. It is enabled by default.
* MEMSTATS command will report available Physical and Virtual Memory in Mb.
  You will notice the number will never rise, this is on purpose.
  Please read the DJGPP FAQ @ http://www.delorie.com/djgpp//v2faq/faq15_2.html
  for more information on how DJGPP and CWSDPMI work.
* Logitch MouseWare drivers in Windows 9x may cause delayed/missing mouse input
  when played in a Windows 9x DOS box.
* Demos recorded from multiplayer can be run with timedemo 1 but to keep the
  code simple it must be used with the demomap command instead of map.  Demomap
  will set the attractloop mode on which can be used as a hint from the client
  that a demo is currently playing without having to hack between the server
  and client.  Starting a demo with demomap is easy, i.e.  demomap demo1.dm2.
  The extension must be incldued.
