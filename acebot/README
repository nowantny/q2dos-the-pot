Bot Name: ACE (Artificial Control Experiment)
Current Version: 007
Author: Steave Yeager

Features:
- Full Client Emulation.
This allows the bot to act very much 'humanlike'.
- Complex Level Navigation.
This is the part of the bot that allows it move around, almost 'humanlike', around some of the many complex levels in Quake II.
- Support for CTF, Teamplay, and use of all Game Items.
The bot is now able to use all game items ('cept for hand grenades). It is also able to play with you in mods such as CTF, instead of just DM.
- Complex AI.
The bot now works with a fuzzy logic type system, for all movements, and decisions alike.
- Complex Movement.
The ACE bot is able to jump, crouch, and is also able to get 'out of the way', when certain obstacles arise.
- Built-in pathing editor.
This allows the bot to be ready for any level, once properly 'taught'.
- Improved combat skills.
Combat abilities have been improved, and will basically, shoot and chase you until they finally get there target.
- Improved server support.
